# DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

## Project Description
The purpose of this low fidelity prototype testing is to better understand how target users will interact with the cooking website I am designing. From past testing and persona/scenario development, I have gathered data that will aid me in the creation of my website and guide me in the decisions I make regarding the interface design. I will be utilizing low fidelity prototype testing to see whether certain features I want to implement are successful and useful. Through a series of tasks, I will gain a deeper understanding of how easy my site is to navigate and how users interact with the interface. 

The user personas I created were busy middle aged women with real-life responsibilities and concerns. I want the website I create to be easily accessible for women of all technical and cooking levels. I also strive to create something that will cater to users' specific needs regarding time constraints and dietary needs. Thus, the features I wanted to implement are a sort/filter option while searching, a save-to-folder feature that is connected to a personal account on the site, and a rating/review system for each recipe. 

## Tasks Supported
1. Sort recipe search by rating/cook time/newest/etc.
2. Save recipes to folder on website.
3. Leave a rating and review on a recipe.

### Insights from testing
#### Task 1: Sort recipe
The participant was able to smoothly navigate the wireframes to find a recipe and sort by ratings. I was worried that there would be confusion with both the "filter by" and "sort" options on the search page. However, the user had no trouble finding the sort option. I believe that the dropdown arrows I provided in the design from the "RECIPES" tab and the "Sort" button were helpful to the user as they could easily identify that there were more options under those categories. 

#### Task 2: Save recipe
It took the user some time to find the save button on the recipe page, but overall, there was no trouble in completing this task. I wanted the participant to access the folder through his account after saving the recipe, but he overlooked doing that. However, I think I did not give him clear enough instruction for this task, so that is something I will work on in future testing.

#### Task 3: Leave review
The participant easily found the review button on the recipe page and left a review. One thing I noticed is that he called the icon I used a "chat" icon. I wonder if this could cause confusion in other users about the purpose of that button. Otherwise, the task went smoothly and there were no major obstacles or confusions.

## Reflection
Overall, the prototype testing went very well. For the most part, there were no major hiccups or confusions presented. A minor problem encountered was the confusion of the button to leave a review. The tester recognized the icon as a "chat" icon rather than a comment one. If I were to revise my prototype, I might pick a different icon or change the button to "Leave a Review." Furthermore, as a moderator, I feel that I could have been more clear with my instructions for the tasks, as my tester did not accomplish everything I wanted in the second task. Looking back, I feel that with clearer instruction, the user would have gone through the wireframes I intended. A feature I found to be particularly successful is the sort option. The user found the button relatively easily and I think that the arrows I used to convey dropdown menus were effective. Ultimately, the testing was very successful and I am happy with where my product is currently.
