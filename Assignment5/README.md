# DH150 Assignment 5: Persona + Scenario

## Introduction: The Purpose of UX Storytelling
The purpose of UX storytelling is to give the designer a deeper understanding of the user so that they can implement necessary changes to their product. By creating personas and stepping into the mind of a potential user, designers gain insight into the thoughts and behaviors that influence how a user interacts with the product. The process can allow us to think though the decision-making process that users go through when accessing the product. Specifically for my project, UX storytelling will allow me to empathize with the various challenges that my target users may face. Thus, I can make changes and introduce features that will combat these obstacles and allow for an improved user experience overall.

## Proposed Features
1. Search Filters: make it possible for users to filter their searches by ingredient, cook time, etc.
2. Saving Feature: users will be able to save recipes they enjoy to a folder on the site for later access
3. Minimalist Design: cut down on excess content to make the recipe more easily accessible
