# DH150 Web Documentation: The Cookbook Website
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

---

## Introduction
The Cookbook is a cooking website that allows users to find and save recipes that appeal to them and their various lifestyles. The website is geared towards middle aged women. I wanted to create The Cookbook in an effort to ease the lives of these busy middle aged women and create a stress-free environment for them to explore the cooking skill while easily implementing the recipes into their lives.

## Design Statement
This UX Design project will be focused around cooking websites geared towards middle aged women. Middle aged women often have a full plate of responsibilities. On an average day, they have to balance working, parenting, and countless other tasks. On top of all that, these women should be putting in the least amount of extra effort to navigate a cooking website thatâ€™s supposed to be designed for their demographic. Cooking at the end of the day should be easy and accessible, rather than a chore. Personally, I feel as though cooking should be a fun experience that one looks forward to. Thus, I want to improve the UX design of such websites over this quarter in an effort to create a comfortable environment for middle aged women to find recipes and cook at ease.

## Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
The two cooking websites I will be evaluating are "Mom On Timeout" and "The Mom 100." Although these websites differ in aesthetic and design, their problems tend to overlap in many categories. In this [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/spolcharoen/DH150-PawanPolcharoen), I hope to identify the ways in which these sites have violated the various heuristics, as well as identify the source of the problem and suggest a potential solution. 

## Competitor Analysis: UT Testing
The purpose of [usability testing](https://github.com/spolcharoen/DH150-PawanPolcharoen/tree/main/Assignment2) (UT) is to identify issues with the product design and improve the overall usability and satisfaction of a product. In contrast to heuristic evaluation, UT provides a more accurate inspection of how a random participant would interact with a product. It is necessary to test whether a product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory for users. The UT process can also inform potential users about the unreleased project, as well as help identify problems in the interface early, eliminating possible future spending and damage control.

## UX storytelling
The purpose of [UX storytelling](https://github.com/spolcharoen/DH150-PawanPolcharoen/tree/main/Assignment5) is to give the designer a deeper understanding of the user so that they can implement necessary changes to their product. By creating personas and stepping into the mind of a potential user, designers gain insight into the thoughts and behaviors that influence how a user interacts with the product. The process can allow us to think though the decision-making process that users go through when accessing the product. Specifically for my project, UX storytelling will allow me to empathize with the various challenges that my target users may face. Thus, I can make changes and introduce features that will combat these obstacles and allow for an improved user experience overall.

For the Impression Test, I presented the following three different mockups with various fonts and colors to my participant. Insights from the test can be found [here](https://github.com/spolcharoen/DH150-PawanPolcharoen/blob/main/Assignment7/README.md). From the data collected, I decided to utilize the design choices in Mockup 3 for the rest of my screen designs.
