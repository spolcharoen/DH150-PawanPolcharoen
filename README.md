**Overall Evaluation:**

### 1. Visibility of System Status
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
2 | The menu bar is only visible at the top of the webpage and disappears while scrolling. This would result in confusion for the user about what page they are on. | Have the menu bar stay at the top of the webpage as the user scrolls down. In addition, there could be button to close the menu bar if the user does not wish to see it while scrolling.
1 | After clicking on a page from the menu bar and being redirected, there is no visual change on the menu to indicate what page the user is on. | Have the page title in the menu bar highlighted in a different color when the user is on that specific page.
1 | When clicking on a recipe, there is no visual indication presented other than the clicker mouse changing. Other buttons on the website tend to change color when hovered on. Clicking a recipe should have the same high visibility of status. | Change the font from blue to orange when hovered on.

### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
2 | The menu bar has a page titled “DISNEY.” To someone unfamiliar with the creator’s Disney inspired recipes, this could be confusion as Disney is not usually associated with food and recipes. | Move “DISNEY” to a subcategory under the “RECIPES” page or retitle the page “DISNEY RECIPES” for more clarity.
1 | At the bottom of every recipe page, there are buttons to see the previous and next recipe pages. These buttons are stacked on top of each other instead of placed side-by-side. This is counterintuitive to what a user would naturally associate with previous and next commands, which are usually placed side-by-side. | Place the links in the same row.

### 3. User Control and Freedom
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 | There is no obvious way to clear a comment or undo writing in the comment and replies section under each recipe. | Add a “Clear Comment” button.
2 | The menu bar is only visible at the top of the webpage and disappears while scrolling. This makes is difficult for users to redirect to a different page if they want to. | Have the menu bar stay at the top of the webpage as the user scrolls down. In addition, there could be button to close the menu bar if the user does not wish to see it while scrolling.
3 | Ads are placed sporadically throughout the blog articles and recipes, making it hard for users to concentrate on the main content of the website. Plus, it is easy to accidentally click on an ad while reading a recipe post. | Place ads strictly in the sidebar, instead of dispersed within the writing content to avoid confusion.

### 4. Consistency and Standards
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content column 1 | Content column 2 | Content column 3

### 5. Error Prevention
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content column 1 | Content column 2 | Content column 3

### 6. Recognition Rather than Recall
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content column 1 | Content column 2 | Content column 3

### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content column 1 | Content column 2 | Content column 3

### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content column 1 | Content column 2 | Content column 3

### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2 | Content cell 3
Content column 1 | Content column 2 | Content column 3

### 10. Help and Documentation
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation

## Website 2: The Mom 100

**Overall Evaluation:**

### 1. Visibility of System Status
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
2 | When hovered above and clicked, the arrows in the slideshows across the website give no visual indication that the user is actively over a button. The mouse does not change and neither does the design. | Have the mouse clicker change, as well as the arrow highlight or bolded when hovered above or clicked on.

### 2. Match Between System and the Real World
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 | The menu bar has a page titled, “Kitchen Smarts,” which contains cooking basics and tips. This terminology could be confusing to new users. | Title the page a more universal title, such as “Cooking Basics” or “Kitchen Basics.”
2 | At the top of every recipe page, there is a downwards arrow that lets the user skip the blog writing and jump straight to the recipe. Although helpful, this button is not labeled “Jump to Recipe,” but instead is just the downward arrow. Users who are unfamiliar with cooking websites are not likely to know what the function of this button is. | Add a “Jump to Recipe” label to the arrow.

### 3. User Control and Freedom
Severity (1-3) | Problem | Recommendation
------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 | There is no obvious way to clear a comment or undo writing in the comment and replies section under each recipe. | Add a “Clear Comment” button.
