Overall, the pilot test went well, with only some minor issues. As the moderator, I feel that I did a good job of staying positive and remaining neutral throughout the process. Over the course of the three tasks and the questionnaire, I made sure to thank the participant for their feedback about the website. I am glad the participant commented on the excessive amount of scrolling needed to get to recipe, since that it one of the main problems I noticed during my heuristic evaluation.

On the other hand, the participant was not as vocal as I wanted him to be, so I feel that some of his thought process was undocumented. In addition, I was not sure how to encourage him to speak more without appearing biased or demanding. Furthermore, it would have been more effective if my participant was a member of the target demographic of the website. Since my participant is younger and more familiar with technology, I felt that he had an easy time navigating the website. A middle-aged woman, who is not as tech-savvy, might not have the same experience.
