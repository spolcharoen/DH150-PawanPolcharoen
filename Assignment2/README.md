## Purpose of Usability Testing
The purpose of usability testing (UT) is to identify issues with the product design and improve the overall usability and satisfaction of a product. In contrast to heuristic evaluation, UT provides a more accurate inspection of how a random participant would interact with a product. It is necessary to test whether a product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory for users. The UT process can also inform potential users about the unreleased project, as well as help identify problems in the interface early, eliminating possible future spending and damage control.

## Methodology
For my UT, I will be building on my heuristic evaluation on the “Mom on Timeout” food blog. From my previous evaluation, I found that the biggest issue with the website is the cluttered nature of the recipe pages. This causes issues with User Control and Freedom, Efficiency of Use, Aesthetics, etc. In addition, the website does not allow for the user to search for recipes containing specific ingredients, hindering the Flexibility of the website. Thus, I wanted to test how these problems could hinder the experience of finding a recipe. 

Through three tasks, I will be testing the usability of the “Mom on Timeout” website. Task 1 involves finding a recipe for turkey burgers for a family weekend dinner. This task is designed to test how easily the user can find the recipe and how easily they can identify how long the dish will take to make. Task 2 involves the user finding an appetizer dish for a dinner party and changing the amount of servings. This task tests how easily the user can navigate the menu bar and customize a recipe. Task 3 involves finding a dessert recipe that will use bananas. This task will evaluate how easy it is for the user to search for a specific ingredient within a subpage.

In combination with these tasks, the participant will have to complete a pre-test and post-test questionnaire. These questions will evaluate the difficulty level and time it took to complete the tasks. The UT will be conducted and recorded over Zoom. It is intended to be a pilot test.

## Reflection
Overall, the pilot test went well, with only some minor issues. As the moderator, I feel that I did a good job of staying positive and remaining neutral throughout the process. Over the course of the three tasks and the questionnaire, I made sure to thank the participant for their feedback about the website. I am glad the participant commented on the excessive amount of scrolling needed to get to recipe, since that it one of the main problems I noticed during my heuristic evaluation.

On the other hand, the participant was not as vocal as I wanted him to be, so I feel that some of his thought process was undocumented. In addition, I was not sure how to encourage him to speak more without appearing biased or demanding. Furthermore, it would have been more effective if my participant was a member of the target demographic of the website. Since my participant is younger and more familiar with technology, I felt that he had an easy time navigating the website. A middle-aged woman, who is not as tech-savvy, might not have the same experience.
