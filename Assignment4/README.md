# DH150 Assignment 4: Users in Context

## Project Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project will support users in finding cooking recipes with ease. Specifically, the project aims to provide middle aged women with an efficient and enjoyable experience when finding delicious and simple recipes online.
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for the main activity is the user's physiological needs. People need to eat to live, and this need is a the main motivation for people finding recipes to cook to home.
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Currently, most people turn to home cooking or eating out as a solution to satify the physioligical need for food. People will find recipes either online or in cookbooks. 
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A limitation that could possibly be improved with technology is the ability to serach for certain ingredients in one's home. When looking at a physical cookbook, there are limited options and the recipes may not cater to what the user currently has stocked up in their pantry or their dietary restrictions.

## Target users 
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
The demographic this project will be focusing on is middle aged women.
#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users would turn to a search browser, such as Google, to find a recipe.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would look in their pantry for what ingredients they have on hand or follow a craving for a certain dish, and look that up in the search browser.

## Research Method(s)
The research method used in this study is an interview with participartory observation. To prepare for the main interview, I wrote a contectual inquiry guide to help aid the process and clarify the purpose and goals of the study. This guide contains an introduction for the interview participant, as well as sets of questions revolving around background, context, user activity, and problems. These various sections are geared to learn more about the participant and how they find recipes online. In addition, they provide context to better understand the participant and why they make certain choices.

Due to the pandemic, the study was conducted and recorded over Zoom and transcribed using Otter.ai.

### Insights from the Interview
#### 1. The user looks for high ratings/reviews and low cook time.
"I do look at cooking time because I don't really want to spend a long time cooking and ingredient wise I don't necessarily pay attention to that as much. Um, unless it requires something that I don't have."

"And like this one has five stars, so I'd usually just choose whichever one has the most reviews or stars on it."
#### 2. The user usually has a dish or ingredient in mind before searching.
"Usually, it's a certain way to cook certain foods that I know I want to use. And not necessarily ingredients but I would probably say more of a dish."
#### 3. The user does not have a specific cooking website they always go to.
"I don't necessarily have a particular website, but I usually just look for the recipe that has like, the higher rating or like reviews, I guess."

"I guess when I look at cooking websites, I just like look at one recipe and then I exit the site."
#### 4. The user would enjoy a more categorized website that allows for specific searches, as well as a website with an option to save recipes.
"So I guess a website where more specific categories are available or a tab where you can just save all the ones you've looked at or you've liked. Or if they give you suggestions related to stuff that you've already made."
#### 5. The user does not read the narrative writing content prior to looking at the recipe.
"And I never read the introductions. Usually."

"Some of it is just storytelling that I feel like is not necessary. And all that I just wanted to see is the cook time and what the spices or seasoning they use. Or what vegetables are actually cooking."

## Reflection
Short reflection on what you learned and what you will do differently in the future.
