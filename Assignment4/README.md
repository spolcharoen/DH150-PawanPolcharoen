# DH150 Assignment 4: Users in Context
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

---

## Project Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project will support users in finding cooking recipes with ease. Specifically, the project aims to provide middle aged women with an efficient and enjoyable experience when finding delicious and simple recipes online.
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for the main activity is the user's physiological needs. People need to eat to live, and this need is a the main motivation for people finding recipes to cook to home.
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Currently, most people turn to home cooking or eating out as a solution to satify the physioligical need for food. People will find recipes either online or in cookbooks. 
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A limitation that could possibly be improved with technology is the ability to serach for certain ingredients in one's home. When looking at a physical cookbook, there are limited options and the recipes may not cater to what the user currently has stocked up in their pantry or their dietary restrictions.

## Target users 
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
The demographic this project will be focusing on is middle aged women.
#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users would turn to a search browser, such as Google, to find a recipe.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would look in their pantry for what ingredients they have on hand or follow a craving for a certain dish, and look that up in the search browser.

## Research Method(s)
