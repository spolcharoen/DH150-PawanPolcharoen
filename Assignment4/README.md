## Project Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project will support users in finding cooking recipes with ease. Specifically, the project aims to provide middle aged women with an efficient and enjoyable experience when finding delicious and simple recipes online.
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for the main activity is the user's physiological needs. People need to eat to live, and this need is a the main motivation for people finding recipes to cook to home.
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Currently, most people turn to home cooking or eating out as a solution to satify the physioligical need for food. People will find recipes either online or in cookbooks. 
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
A limitation that could possibly be improved with technology is the ability to serach for certain ingredients that are currently in one's home. When looking at a physical cookbook, there are limited options and the recipes may not cater to what the user currently has stocked up in their pantry or their dietary restrictions. Online, there is a large scope of recipes available that can be explored.

## Target Users 
#### What are the characteristics of users?
The demographic this project will be focusing on is middle aged women. Specifically, I want to focus on busy mothers that are looking for easy meals that won't detract from their schedule, work, or family. These women most likely prefer easy recipes with minimal ingredients and low cooking times. They are usually home cooks without professional experience or expertise. The familiarity with technology varies greatly among the demographic. Thus, it is most safe assume that a simple interface would be prefered overall.
#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users would turn to a search browser, such as Google, to find a recipe. Otherwise, users would look at family recipes or cookbooks available to them at home. Before searching, users would probably have an idea of what dish or ingredient they want to use up.
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would look in their pantry for what ingredients they have on hand or follow a craving for a certain dish, and look that up in the search browser or cookbook. Moreover, some users might have a certain cooking website they already prefer to look up recipes on. After searching for a certain dish or ingredient, the user would choose a recipe based on personal criteria. Then, they would proceed to follow the recipe or take inspiration from it, cooking a meal for themselves or their family.

## Research Method(s)
The research method used in this study is an interview with participartory observation. To prepare for the main interview, I wrote a contectual inquiry guide to help aid the process and clarify the purpose and goals of the study. This guide contains an introduction for the interview participant, as well as sets of questions revolving around background, context, user activity, and problems. These various sections are geared to learn more about the participant and how they find recipes online. In addition, they provide context to better understand the participant and why they make certain choices.

Due to the pandemic, the study was conducted and recorded over Zoom and transcribed using Otter.ai.

### Insights from the Interview
#### 1. The user looks for high ratings/reviews and low cook time.
"I do look at cooking time because I don't really want to spend a long time cooking and ingredient wise I don't necessarily pay attention to that as much. Um, unless it requires something that I don't have."

"And like this one has five stars, so I'd usually just choose whichever one has the most reviews or stars on it."
#### 2. The user usually has a dish or ingredient in mind before searching.
"Usually, it's a certain way to cook certain foods that I know I want to use. And not necessarily ingredients but I would probably say more of a dish."
#### 3. The user does not have a specific cooking website they always go to.
"I don't necessarily have a particular website, but I usually just look for the recipe that has like, the higher rating or like reviews, I guess."

"I guess when I look at cooking websites, I just like look at one recipe and then I exit the site."
#### 4. The user would enjoy a more categorized website that allows for specific searches, as well as a website with an option to save recipes.
"So I guess a website where more specific categories are available or a tab where you can just save all the ones you've looked at or you've liked. Or if they give you suggestions related to stuff that you've already made."
#### 5. The user does not read the narrative writing content prior to looking at the recipe.
"And I never read the introductions. Usually."

"Some of it is just storytelling that I feel like is not necessary. And all that I just wanted to see is the cook time and what the spices or seasoning they use. Or what vegetables are actually cooking."

## Reflection
Overall, I gained a lot of new insight from the interview. Prior to the process, I thought I had a relatively clear idea about what problem areas I wanted to address in my design. Although some of these were reinforced with the interview, the participant also gave me some new areas to look at in the future. I enjoyed how the contextual inquiry gave me more information on the participant and their background. I felt that this gave me a more hollistic perspective of how and why the user was making certain choices. For example, I did not realize the emphasis that is placed on ratings and reviews when looking for a recipe. Beforehand, I was focused on cooking time and ingredient availability, but my participant opened my eyes to this new criteria. Furthermore, I enjoyed hearing about what her dream cooking website would consist of. Specifically, I found her idea about having a way to save recipes very creative.

In the future, I would want to spend more time perfecting my questions. I had some trouble coming up with them, and I feel they got repetitive in some parts. Also, I wanted my participant to make more comments regarding the website interface, but she talked more generally about her experiences. If I were to do this study again, I would try to write more pointed questions about the website itself and that particular user experience. Lastly, it would have been better to interview someone closer to my target demographic. 

Ultimately, I learned a lot from my participant and really enjoyed the process of creating and conducting the interview. I feel that I now have a better understanding of how users interact with cooking websites and what they value when finding a recipe.
