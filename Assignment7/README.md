# DH150 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

---

## Project Description
For this project, I will be prototyping a cooking website, "The Cookbook," geared towards middle aged women. My decisions regarding color scheme and interface design will be rooted in findings from my past evaluations, user testings, and persona scenarios. The purpose of creating a high fidelity prototype is to create interactive visuals for the final project and test its ability to support certain tasks. With this information, I will be able to tweak my designs to better support my target demographic and the tasks they want to complete. 

## Tasks Supported
1. Sort recipe search by level of rating.
    * go to "Breakfast" page under "Recipes" tab
    * click "Sort" button and then click "Ratings"
    * recipes will rearrange and sort by highest to lowest rating

2. Save recipe to folder on website and access that folder through your account.
    * go to "Breakfast" page under "Recipes" tab
    * click on "Crispy Fried Egg" recipe
    * click "Save" button and then "Breakfasts"
    * click on Account icon at top right and then "Saved"
    * click on "Breakfasts" folder to see saved recipe in folder

3. Navigate to recipe page and leave a rating and review.
    * go to "Breakfast" page under "Recipes" tab
    * click on "Crispy Fried Egg" recipe
    * click on Review icon by the five stars
    * write review and click "Post"

## Decision-making Process
**Color Scheme:** For my screen designs, I chose a warm and neutral color scheme, consisting of a pale yellow background with white, brown, black accents. Initially, I was debating between the neutral scheme and a more bright and vibrant color scheme, but I decided to go with the more neutral option after the findings of my Impression Test. I feel that the neutral colors allow the photographs of the food to pop more, while creating a cozy and inviting aesthetic for the site overall. Using both brown and black allowed me to create a contrast between the text and the accent pieces; I used black to accent and visually draw users to the text and headings, while utilizing the brown for buttons and other design components. Moreover, I solidified my choice after checking the colors with the accesibility color contrast test. The results of this test can be found below.

**Fonts:** Initially, I used the Vesper Libre font as the main font for my logo and headers. However, after exploring more options on Figma and after my Impression Test, I decided on Galada. Galada gave more visual interest and brought a playful touch to the more serious neutral color scheme. For subheadings and body text, I used a mixture of Poly and Roboto font. I chose Poly because it was easy to read, but was still appealing to look at for headings. For my filters and body text, I chose Roboto because it is a simple font that is very easy to read, which I believe will be helpful for middle aged women that may struggle with reading on a device.

**Images and Icons:** For the images of the food, I focused on finding photographs with natural lightings and bright backgrounds. I found that this combination made the food look fresh and inviting. Furthermore, I chose simple monotone icons for logo, headers, and the save button. I believe these icons create interest and give personality to the site. The search, save, and review icons are common icons that I hope will help users pick up on the button's usage without having to read any text.

## Impression Test

For the Impression Test, I presented the following three different mockups with various fonts and colors to my participant. Insights from the test can be found below. From the data collected, I decided to utilize the design choices in Mockup 3 for the rest of my screen designs.

### Summary of Impression Test
1. User prefers the neutral color scheme, since it is less harsh visually. Additionally, she prefers the brown recipe labels to the pale yellow becuase they give more visual contrast.
2. User prefers Galada font for the logo/headers instead of Vesper Libre. They also prefer Poly font for the body text instead of Hanuman. 
3. User prefers the coffee icon in mockups 2 and 3 instead of the one in mockup 1, because it does not take away from the main logo icon.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

### Summary of Cognitive Walkthrough
1. The purpose of the website is clear to users at first glance. It is clearly a website having to due with food and cooking.
2. There is confusion with the button to comment and leave a review on a recipe. Clicking leads to the same page instead of scrolling down and leading to review section.
3. Back-flow is clear and available on most pages. 

## Reflection
Overall, creating and designing a high fidelity prototype for "The Cookbook" website was very informative and fun! The whole process went very smoothly. I was able to create different designs and test them as I went. I enjoyed taking feedback from the impression test and the cognitive walkthrough and implementing changes in my screen designs and wireflow. For the most part, I did not have any major difficulties when designing or putting in interactions. However, I did struggle with the review button. I wanted the site page to scroll down after one clicked on the review button on the recipe page, but Figma does not have this option. Thus, I had to create a separate screen and change the interaction to "Smart Animate" for the scrolling effect. Other than this, everything went well in my design process and I look forward to working further on the cooking site.

From the feedback I got from prototype testing, I already made changes to my designs. From the impression test, I finalized my color scheme, fonts, and icons. From the cognitive walkthrough, I fixed the usage of the review section and added more interactions to better facilitate task 3. In addition to extra screens and wireflows, I added a magnifying glass to the search bar for aesthetics and easier recognition. In the future, I hope to flesh out the review section and design the page for posted reviews. Furthermore, I would like to develop the search and filter by options to be interactive and usable. Ultimately, the process of designing this high fidelity prototype was successful and I am excited for what's to come with further work.
