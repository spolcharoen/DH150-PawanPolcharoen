# DH150 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype Part 1
by Pawan (Sine) Polcharoen

## Project Description
A brief description of your project, the purpose and process of this prototyping phase (3-5 sentences)
For this project, I will be prototyping a cooking website, "The Cookbook," geared towards middle aged women. My decisions regarding color scheme and interface design will be rooted in findings from my past evaluations, user testings, and persona scenarios. The purpose of creating a high fidelity prototype is to create actual interactive visuals for the final project and test its ability to support certain tasks. With this information, I will be able to tweak my designs to better support my target demographic. 

## Tasks Supported
1. Sort recipe search by level of rating.
2. Save recipe to "Breakfasts" folder on website and access that folder through your account.
3. Leave a rating and review on a recipe.

## Decision-making Process
**Color Scheme:** For my screen designs, I chose a warm and neutral color scheme, consisting of a pale yellow background with white, brown, black accents. Initially, I was debating between a more bright and vibrant color scheme, but I decided to go with the more neutral option after the findings of my impression test. 

**Fonts:**

### Insights from the Impression Test
1. User prefers the neutral color scheme, since it is less harsh visually. Additionally, she prefers the brown recipe labels to the pale yellow becuase they give more visual contrast.
2. User prefers Galada font for the logo/headers instead of Vesper Libre. They also prefer Poly font for the body text instead of Hanuman. 
3. User prefers the coffee icon in mockups 2 and 3 instead of the one in mockup 1, because it does not take away from the main logo icon.
